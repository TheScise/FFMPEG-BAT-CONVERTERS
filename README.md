# FFMPEG BATCH CONVERTERS
## Making video conversion easier.
Sometimes you just want things to be easy. I created these for personal use but thought, perhaps others could get something out of this.

These FFMPEG utility batch files are designed to be placed into the same directory as "ffmpeg.exe", if this is not present it WILL NOT WORK.

I hope this helps save seconds in someones day.

## How to convert the videos.
Drag video files onto the batch file to run them against that video.

Output files will be placed in a directory created named "Output".
