# FFMPEG-BAT-CONVERTERS
These FFMPEG utility batch files are designed to be placed into the same directory as "ffmpeg.exe", if this is not present it WILL NOT WORK.

Drag video files onto the batch file to run them against that video.
Output files will be placed in a directory created named "Output".
